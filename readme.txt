The Mesh 3D widget by Three.js for Elementor.

== Description ==

= Mission =
The goal of this plugin is to create 3D content within websites using the simple Elementor UI interface, where at the base it uses the great/mythical/extraordinary [THREEJS](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) invented by mr Doob.
Building three-dimensional environments composed of objects, lights, shadows and a setting context is not easy.
Our aim is to make this possible, and we have come a long way to make it affordable for everyone.

Good fun.

= Main Features =
In the interface we have inserted these possibilities:

**Objects** 
- **Primitives**. They are basic forms dynamically processed by parameters
-- Cube
-- Sphere
-- Torus
-- Piramid
-- Cylinder
-- Cone
-- Dodecahedron
-- Tetraedron
-- Icosahedron
-- etc
- **SVG**. Import SVG files and extrude the shape.
- **External files**. Created by major 3D programs
-- Blender by the Blender Foundation
-- Substance Painter by Allegorithmic
-- Modo by Foundry
-- Toolbag by Marmoset
-- Houdini by SideFX
-- Cinema 4D by MAXON
-- COLLADA2GLTF by the Khronos Group
